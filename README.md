A stock market is a platform for trading of a companyâ€™s stocks and derivatives at an agreed price. 
Supply and demand of shares drive the stock market. In any country stock market is one of the most emerging sectors. 
Nowadays, many people are indirectly or directly related to this sector. 
Therefore, it becomes essential to know about market trends. 
Thus, with the development of the stock market, people are interested in forecasting stock price. 
But, due to dynamic nature and liable to quick changes in stock price, prediction of the stock price becomes a challenging task. 
Stock markets are mostly a non-parametric, non-linear, noisy and deterministic chaotic system.

As the technology is increasing, stock traders are moving towards to use Intelligent Trading Systems rather than fundamental analysis for predicting prices of stocks, 
which helps them to take immediate investment decisions. One of the main aims of a trader is to predict the stock price such that he can sell it before its value decline, 
or buy the stock before the price rises. The efficient market hypothesis states that it is not possible to predict stock prices and that stock behaves in the random walk. 
It seems to be very difficult to replace the professionalism of an experienced trader for predicting the stock price. 
But because of the availability of a remarkable amount of data and technological advancements we can now formulate an appropriate algorithm for prediction 
whose results can increase the profits for traders. 

Thus, the accuracy of an algorithm is directly proportional to gains made by using the algorithm.
