A stock market is a platform for trading of a companyâ€™s stocks and derivatives at an agreed price. 
Supply and demand of shares drive the stock market. With the development of global equity market and trading/investing becoming more prevalent, it becomes essential to understand current market trends at a deeper level.
Due to the dynamic nature and liablility to sudden and extreme changes in stock price, prediction of the stock price is often very difficult. Stock markets are mostly a non-parametric, non-linear, noisy and deterministic chaotic system.

As technology increases, stock traders are moving towards to use Intelligent Trading Systems (algos) rather than fundamental analysis for predicting prices of stocks, 
which helps them to take immediate investment decisions. One of the main aims of a trader is to predict the stock price such that he can sell it before its value decline, 
or buy the stock before the price rises. The efficient market hypothesis states that it is not possible to predict stock prices and that stock behaves in the random walk. 
It seems to be very difficult to replace the professionalism of an experienced trader for predicting the stock price, but because of the availability of a remarkable amount of data and technological advancements we can now formulate an appropriate algorithm for prediction 
whose results can increase the profits for traders. 


The goal of this project is to utilize regression and classifying techniques to construct a model that best understands the how different market indices and conditions inter-operate and factor into the share prices for SPY and QQQ, large-cap stocks, as well as top cryptocurrencies. The accuracy of an algorithm is directly proportional to gains made by using the algorithm during historical back-testing.
